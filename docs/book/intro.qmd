# Introduction

cyllama is a zero-dependency Python library for local AI inference. It provides high-performance Cython bindings to three powerful C++ inference engines:

- **llama.cpp** - Large language model inference for text generation, chat, and embeddings

- **whisper.cpp** - Automatic speech recognition (ASR) supporting 100+ languages

- **stable-diffusion.cpp** - Image and video generation from text prompts

## Why cyllama?

### Zero Dependencies

Unlike other Python LLM libraries that require PyTorch, TensorFlow, or other heavy frameworks, cyllama compiles directly against the C++ libraries. The only requirement is a GGUF model file.

### High Performance

By wrapping optimized C++ code with Cython (not Python bindings), cyllama achieves near-native performance:

- GPU acceleration via Metal (macOS), CUDA (NVIDIA), Vulkan (cross-platform)
- Efficient memory management with KV caching
- Batch processing for 3-10x throughput improvements
- Speculative decoding for 2-3x faster generation

### Pythonic API

Despite the low-level foundations, cyllama provides a clean, Pythonic interface:

```python
from cyllama import complete

response = complete(
    "Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
    model_path="models/llama.gguf",
    temperature=0.7
)
print(response)
```

## What This Book Covers

This documentation is organized into several parts:

**Llama.cpp** - Text generation with large language models, including the high-level API, streaming, batch processing, server implementations, and advanced features like speculative decoding and context caching.

**Whisper.cpp** - Speech-to-text transcription with support for timestamps, translation, and voice activity detection.

**Stable-Diffusion.cpp** - Image generation from text prompts, supporting SD 1.x/2.x, SDXL, SD3, FLUX, and video generation models.

**Agents** - A zero-dependency agent framework with three architectures: `ReActAgent` for general-purpose tasks, `ConstrainedAgent` for grammar-enforced tool calls, and `ContractAgent` for runtime verification.

## Getting Started

cyllama uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python package management. uv is a modern Python package manager written in Rust that provides:

- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip for dependency resolution and installation
- **Reliability**: Deterministic builds with lockfile support
- **Simplicity**: Single tool for virtual environments, packages, and Python version management

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/shakfu/cyllama.git
cd cyllama

# Sync dependencies (uv creates the virtual environment automatically)
uv sync

# Build cyllama
make

# Download a test model
make download

# Try it out in a python terminal
uv run python
```

```python
>>> from cyllama import complete
>>> response = complete('Hello!', model_path='models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf')
>>> print(response)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
make test

# Or use uv directly
uv run pytest tests/
```

### Using uv Commands

Common uv commands for development:

```bash
uv sync              # Install/sync all dependencies
uv add package       # Add a new dependency
uv run python ...    # Run Python in the virtual environment
uv run pytest ...    # Run pytest
uv pip list          # List installed packages
```
